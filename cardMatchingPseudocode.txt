When a cell is clicked the cardClicked function is called.

make a 'cardsTurnedOver' array - shows the cards that have been clicked on and are a potential match.
new flag called 'potentialMatch'

on each cardClicked event.

check if the card has recently clicked (the card is already turned over and is showing - so it doesn't turn back over) and if it hasn't been, then:
(e.g. if(card is not in cardsTurnedOver){})
    if(potentialMatch is false){
        flip over the previous cards in cardsTurnedOver - add 'hideCard' to each imgs class and removing showCard class (iterate over each child of cardsTurnedOver)
        clear cardsTurnedOver array.
        set potentialMatch to true.
    }
    add cellClicked to cardsTurnedOver

    check for a match:
    if(length of cardsTurnedOver > 1):
	    iterate over cardsTurnedOver array - if they all match: comparing each img.src
		if the length of cardsTurnedOver equals 'numberOfCardsToMatch' (numberOfCardsToMatch is the last digit in the cells id) then remove all event listeners from the clicked cells, 
		    add points to the tally, and add cardsTurnedOver array to the matchedCells array.
		else:
		    set potentialMatch to true
	    If no match:
		set potentialMatch to false.
